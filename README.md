PyCamellia

Currently, this is a workspace for students of Wheaton College’s CSCI 335, Software Development, to work on their semester project, a set of Python interfaces for Camellia.

While the repository is publicly readable, it’s not currently intended for general consumption.  It is hoped that some of the software developed here will make its way back into the CamelliaDPG project.
