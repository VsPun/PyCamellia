To build PyCamellia, there are three steps:
1. Build Trilinos with shared libraries (and, ideally, PyTrilinos support, though this is probably not actually required).
2. Build Camellia, linking against that Trilinos build.
3. Build PyCamellia.

Steps 1 and 2 are beyond the scope of this document, but you can find a sample do-configure script for Trilinos, as well as one for Camellia, enclosed with PyCamellia.

As of this writing, though Trilinos has a make install option Camellia does not, so you'll likely want to move the built library and copy the header files to some convenient location before proceeding to Step 3.

Once Steps 1 and 2 are accomplished, building PyCamellia requires editing the Makefile in PyCamellia/swig_interface.  Change each of the paths listed to match your installation.  Once that's accomplished, simply run make from within the swig_interface directory.

You'll want to add the swig_interface directory to your PYTHONPATH, so that Python will know where to look for the Python modules.
