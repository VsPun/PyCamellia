This is a file to help you install pyton on your computer. 
If you are not aware, pyton is the more 'thug' version of python (not installed by default on lab computers). 
Pyton is dependent on python being installed though.


(1) Open .bashrc in in your home directory
(2) paste below #User specific aliases and fucntions:
	pyton() { echo -e "\nYo, welcome to pyton, thug, you keep playin, \n\n"; python $@; }
